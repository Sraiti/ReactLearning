## State
 the same concepts of lifting-up state are used in React  just like flutter 
 and props are used to pass data down the components tree 
 and you should always use setState to update the state
 and never set state directly  o that react can do its magic and change just what needs to be changed, you can only set state directly in the constructor 

flutter and react as far as I see have so much in common
